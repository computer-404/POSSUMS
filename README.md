# POSSUMS: Parameters for Optimizing Scientific Sampling Using Momentary-time-sampling Simulator
## Details
POSSUMS produces Monte Carlo simulations (based on user-specified values) and automatically generates statistics relevant to understanding the extent to which measurement error may be expected within multisubject design parameters. 
## Installation and Running Instructions
After cloning the repository one can:
1. Run the python file titled "brompsimulator.py", and this should automatically produce the GUI necessary to run the algorithm.
2. Inside of the Executable Information folder, pan to the dist/brompsimulator directory and the brompsimulator file should be an executable that can be used to run the algorithm.

For Macbook users:
If your computer says that the executable cannot be ran because it is from an unidentified developer then you can:
1. Go to Systems Settings/Systems Preferences
2. Go to the Privacy & Security tab
3. Under the Security section there should be a block that says that the executable was blocked because it is from an unidentifiable developer, in the bottom corner of this box there should be a button that says Open Anyway, which should allow the executable to be ran.
